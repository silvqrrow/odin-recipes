    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 green bell peppers</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup uncooked rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup</li>
        <li>water as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cut the tops off bell peppers and remove the seeds.
            Cook bell peppers in boiling water for 5 minutes; drain. Sprinkle salt inside each bell pepper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. 
            Drain off excess fat and season with salt and pepper. Stir in tomatoes, 1/2 cup water, rice, and Worcestershire sauce; 
            reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cheese.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stuff each bell pepper with beef and rice mixture; arrange open-side up in a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Combine tomato soup with just enough water in a medium bowl to make the soup a gravy consistency; 
            pour over the bell peppers and cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted and bubbly, about 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
