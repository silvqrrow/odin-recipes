    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make German-style pork schnitzel, pork loin chops are pounded thin, breaded, and quickly pan fried until crisp and delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) boneless pork loin chops, trimmed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon table salt, divided</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>chopped fresh thyme for garnish</li>
        <li>lemon wedges for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 1 pork chop between 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a clean work surface or cutting board.
            Pound pork chop using a meat mallet until 1/4-inch thick.
            Transfer to a clean plate. Repeat with remaining pork chops.
            Evenly sprinkle pork chops with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.</li>
        <li>
            Mix together flour, garlic powder, onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a shallow dish. 
            Place eggs and milk in a separate shallow dish and whisk to combine. 
            Place breadcrumbs in a separate shallow dish. Dip a pork chop in flour, dusting off excess flour; 
            dip in egg mixture, allowing excess to drip off. Place into breadcrumbs; flip and press pork into breadcrumbs until well covered. 
            Repeat with remaining pork chops. Place prepared pork chops on a plate or sheet tray and transfer to the refrigerator, uncovered, 
            for 5 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high. 
            Add 2 pork chops and cook, flipping once, until golden brown on each side and no longer pink in the center,
            2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). 
            Adjust heat to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a clean plate or sheet tray. Pour off and discard oil from pan; wipe skillet clean and place back on stovetop over medium-high. 
            Add remaining 3 tablespoons oil and 1 tablespoon butter and repeat with remaining 2 pork chops. Sprinkle cooked pork chops with remaining 
            1/4 teaspoon salt and thyme. Serve chops with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
